Audiolet - sort of simple javascript audio.

grab it. 
	https://github.com/oampo/Audiolet/blob/master/src/audiolet/Audiolet.js
	Download Audiolet.js, and put it somewhere nice. (over Raw you can select "Save link as")
	
Sooo.... let's make a hello world.

HTML time.

-->
		<script>
			var audiolet;
			window.onload = function() {
				
				
			}

		</script>

	<body>
		<a href="javascript:run()">Click this to do stuff</a>
		<script>
			function run() {
				alert("Hi.");
			}

			/**
			so run this page, and click the first link.
			WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
			except.... popups aren't noise. but are you with me so far?
			**/
		</script>
		<br>
		<a href="javascript:run2()">Click this to do hear stuff (not too loud though)</a>
		<script>

			/** So click the link above. **/

			function run2() {
				var audiolet = new Audiolet();
				var sine = new Sine(audiolet, 440);
				sine.connect(audiolet.output);	
			}

			/**
			Do it. click the button. ISN'T IT AWESOME?!
			ok. now refresh the page before you go crazy.
			**/

		</script>
		<br>
		<a href="javascript:run3()">Click this to do hear bloopy.</a>
		<script>

			/** So click the link above. **/

			function run3() {
				this.audiolet = new Audiolet();

				//create
				this.sine = new Square(audiolet, 440);
				this.modulator = new Saw(this.audiolet, 0.9);
				this.modulatorMulAdd = new MulAdd(this.audiolet, 200, 440);
				this.filter = new LowPassFilter(this.audiolet, 2000);

				//connect
				this.modulator.connect(this.modulatorMulAdd); //0-1  440-640
				this.modulatorMulAdd.connect(this.sine);
				this.sine.connect(this.filter);
				this.filter.connect(this.audiolet.output);
			}

			/**
				OK. OK. If I lost you, sorry. I basically did everything new in this. right now.
				so first thing first:
				THE MAGICAL 'this'. almost wherever you are, it refers to the object you're in. it's magic, for all intents and purposes.
				Remember in PD, how we attached objects to eachother? Oh hai, we're doing that here.

					this.modulator = new Saw(this.audiolet, 0.9);
				So here, we make a modulator to affet the pitch of the sine wave. it's frequency is slow, 0.9 hertz, and it's a saw waveform.

					this.modulatorMulAdd = new MulAdd(this.audiolet, 200, 440);
				And here, we make a way to tranform the [0-1] of the sawtooth wave into 440 + [0-1]*200

					this.modulator.connect(this.modulatorMulAdd);
					this.modulatorMulAdd.connect(this.sine);
					this.sine.connect(this.audiolet.output);
				This is the important part. now we connect everything together.
				just like in PureData, we connect the OUTLET of a specific object to the INPUT of another object.
				and obviously, at the end, we connect it to the output. tadaaaaaaaaaaa.
